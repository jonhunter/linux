* ARM Cross Trigger Interface (CTI)

The ARM Cross Trigger Interface provides a way to route events between
processor modules. For example, debug events from one processor can be
broadcasted to other processors. The events that can be routed between
processors are specific to the device.

Required properties:

- compatible:			Should be "arm,primecell".
- interrupts:			Interrupt associated with CTI module.
- reg:				Contains timer register address range (base
				address and length).
- arm,cti-name:			A unique name for the CTI module, that will be
				used when requesting the CTI module instance.


Optional properties:

- arm-primecell-periphid:	Primecell peripheral ID associated with CTI
				module.


Example:

cti0: cti@0x54148000 {
	compatible = "arm,primecell";
	interrupts = <0 1 0x4>;
	reg = <0x54148000 0x1000>;
	arm,cti-name = "cti0";
	arm,primecell-periphid = <0x003bb906>;
};
